## Cloudinary
Cloudinary is a cloud service that offers a solution to a web application's entire image management pipeline. Easily upload images to the cloud. Automatically perform smart image resizing, cropping and conversion without installing any complex software. Integrate Facebook or Twitter profile image extraction in a snap, in any dimension and style to match your websiteâ€™s graphics requirements. Images are seamlessly delivered through Akamai's fast CDN. By not bogging down GitHub with large images you are also being a good netizen.

When you upload your image to your article in the PageDown editor it will be sent to your Cloudinary account where you can use the web interface to interactively manage your media library. 

## Setup your account
Start by signing up to [Cloudinary][1]. In the dashboard under the headline Account details you have the **Cloud name**, that you need to add in the Appernetic user settings.
