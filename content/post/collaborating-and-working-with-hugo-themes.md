If you just have set up your Appernetic account you need to add a theme. The easiest way is to clone a theme which you can do from the drop down button beside the blue Preview button to the right. 


You probably want to customize the theme before you use it and have a theme that is matching your business web site or service. I am using Bootswatch Paper theme for Appernetic service. Fortunately I found <a href=”https://github.com/mmrath/hugo-bootstrap”>hugo-bootstrap</a> and cloned it. Then to customize it further I pressed the Sync button which does a pull and then a push to your Appernetic project repository at GitHub with the name appernetic.hugo-project . When you start out you will not have this repo so it is automatically created for you. Now to work with the theme I did a pull to my local computer, edited the theme with my favorite editor Atom and after that I did a commit and a push back to my GitHub project repo. Notice also that I have all the collaborating features in GitHub so I can invite a real front end designer to have a look at my attempts to customize the theme. My last step is to do a Sync in Appernetic and then a Publish and after 10 min all is live on GitHub Pages.
