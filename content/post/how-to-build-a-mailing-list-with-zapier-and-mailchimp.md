"I'm looking to put up a 'coming soon' page for a podcast I'm working on to collect some e-mails for the upcoming launch.

What's a good ready-made solution for this (e.g. WordPress plugin, hosted landing page, etc.) that allows for easy lead collection without custom coding or monthly fee?"

That was the question I saw in the 7 Day Startup group on Facebook. Similar questions were asked in Hugo Community discuss : Is it possible to add a contact form to a site?

It seems to be a common pain point.

With a static website, you don't have anything that can process form submissions so it is not a simple task to do it yourself. 

For this, you need a newsletter opt-in form, a mailing list and a service that handles the submitted content.

In our latest theme: hugo-bootstrap-premium we have integrated a newsletter opt-in form that is super easy to customize without any coding.

You only have to enable the form and add your Zapier post hook that's post to MailChimp to use it. 

We also integrated MailMunch and SumoMe so you can use it instead  if you prefer.
