# Carousel
A Carousel is a large, full-width, series of navigable slides. Good for
featuring a series on content with accompanying graphics.

### Usage:
Carousel data is defined within the `carousel` table. Each carousel item is
	then defined within the `carousel.item` array.

### Parameters
* Carousel parameters:
	* id - HTML `id` for the carousel. Defaults to the Page's Section and
			Title, lowercased, and urlized. Ex: 'blog-first-post'
	* height - Height of the carousel. Defaults to size of current graphic image.
			Note that this value is CSS and you need to specify units
	* full_width - (default = `true`). Determines if the carousel stretches the
			entire width of the page. If false, it is put within a container.
	* margin_top - Set the padding above the carousel.
			You may want this in the case that `full_width` is false
	* bg_color - Color of the Carousel's background.
			The background is visible if the image is non-existent or doesn't
			fit the entire width
	* graphic - Default graphic if it is not set on the slide
	* text_color - Default text color if not set by slide
	* text_bg_color - Default color of the background of the text if not
			set by the slide
* Carousel Slide parameters:
	* title - Title of the slide
	* text - Supporting text for the slide
	* graphic - Background image to be used. If not set, will attempt to
			fallback onto `carousel.graphic`
	* text_color - Color of the text and title. Overrides `carousel.text_color`
	* text_bg_color - Color of the background of the text. Overrides `carousel.text_bg_color`

### Example
```toml
[components]
	carousel = true

[carousel]
	height = 500
	bg_color = "#000"
	graphic = "http://lorempixel.com/1200/500/city/1/"
	text_color = "#EEE"
	text_bg_color = "rgba(0,0,0.5)"
[[carousel.slide]]
	title = "Carousel"
	text = "This is the first slide"
[[carousel.slide]]
	title = "Carousel #2"
	text = "This is the second slide. Enjoy the kitten!"
	text_color = "#000"
	bg_color = "rgba(255,255,255.5)"
	graphic = "http://lorempixel.com/1200/500/cats/1/"
```

### CSS Class Markup
* carousel
* carousel-indicators
* carousel-slide
* carousel-control
	* left
	* right

### Notes
If Content sets `components.carousel = false` the carousel won't be shown even
	if it is set to true by the section.
If Content defines the carousel, but only the Section enables it,
	**the Content's version is the one that's shown.**
The carousel has a lower z-index than the `main` class which holds the rest of
	the page.
	This hides the content during scrolling whenever parallax is enabled.

### Todo
* layout - Template file to use for markup
* centered - Ability to center Title, Text, and Buttons
* Insert custom markup
	* You should be able to attach `framework` information to prevent layout
		incompatibilities
