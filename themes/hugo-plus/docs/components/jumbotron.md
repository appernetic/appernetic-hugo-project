# Jumbotron
A jumbotron is just a large full-width banner header usually at the page with
large text, a description, a button or two, and optionally a background image.
These are good for product descriptions or featuring content.

### Usage
Parameters can be specified by either the Section or the Content.
To enable set `components.jumbotron = true` and fill in the jumbotron's parameters.
Jumbotron's data is defined within a [jumbotron] data object.

### Parameters
* components.jumbotron - Enable/disables the jumbotron defined by the Content or Section
* Jumbotron paramters:
	* title - Title's text
	* text - Smaller text 
	* text_color - Color to use for `title` and `text` font. Ex. `#EEE`
	* graphic - Image to be used for the background
	* text_bg_color - Color to use behind the jumbotron's content.
			Use this if text is hard to read against graphic, or change text_color
	* parallax - When scrolling the page, the jumbtron's content and
			`graphic` will scroll slower. Defaults to `true`
	* height - Height of the jumbotron. Defaults to `300px`.
			Note that this value is CSS and you need to specify units
	* full_width - (default = `true`). Determines if the carousel stretches
			the entire width of the page. If false, it is put within a container.
	* margin_top - Set the padding above the jumbotron.
			You may want this in the case that `full_width` is false
* Jumbotron button parameters:
	* text - Text displayed on the button
	* url - URL that the button links to
	* class - Attach class attribute information to the button

### Example
```toml
[components]
jumbotron = true

[jumbotron]
	title = "Hello, Hugo!"
	text = "This is and example of a jumbotron. It is defined within the content's front matter"
	text_color = "#EEE"
	graphic = "http://lorempixel.com/1200/300/city/5"
	text_bg_color = "rgba(0,0,0,.5)"
	parallax = true
[[jumbotron.button]]
	text = "A button"
	url = "#"
	class = "btn-primary"
[[jumbotron.button]]
	text = "Or two"
	url = "#"
	class = "btn-warning"
```

### CSS Class Markup
* jumbotron
* jumbotron-content
* jumbotron-title
* jumbotron-text
* jumbotron-buttons

### Notes
If Content sets `components.jumbotron = false` the jumbotron won't be shown
	even if it is set to true by the section.
If Content defines the jumbotron, but only the Section enables it,
	**the Content's version is the one that's shown.**
The jumbotron's content has a lower z-index than the `main` class which
	holds the rest of the page.
	This hides the content during scrolling whenever parallax is enabled.

### Todo
* layout - Template file to use for markup
* centered - Ability to center Title, Text, and Buttons
* Custom Jumbotrons:
	* Google Maps - http://www.bootply.com/eS6TqlELFG
	* Carousel Jumbotron - http://www.bootply.com/ecMCkrQdGv, http://www.bootply.com/W8c08gujh2
* Insert custom markup
	* You should be able to attach `framework` information to prevent inconsistencies
