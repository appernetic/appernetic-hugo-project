# Specifies Social, Profile/User, and Widget Ids
# The List is within a Table with the same name as the Section it applies to.
# The 'site' Table will be used as the default/fallback.
# A Table Section will completely override the 'site' variables, so a blank
# 	Table will disable all Profile Ids.
#
# Note: When overriding Profiles within the Content's Param section you must
# 	specify which Link Type the ProfileIds belong to (follow, share, social).
