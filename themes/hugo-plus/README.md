# Hugo-plus
A fully featured and customizable Hugo theme that's built using Bootstrap
components.

Hugo-plus provides a base set of customizable features that are able to remain
consistent across theme and layout changes.

### Why?
Hugo lacks a standardized set of features that a Theme should support.
Many of its Themes have hard-coded content which leads inconsistent user
experiences.

This project introduces a basic structure which allows Themes, Layouts,
Components, and Plugins to be reused and customized.

Customization can be done in stages - whether you just want to change the color
palette and fonts, create different Layout Views for the content, or develop
additional Components.


### Who?
Targeted towards lazy developers who want a quick solution to host their
thoughts, projects, and other content while having a basis for further
customization and expansion of the finished product.

# Getting Started
If you already have a Hugo website, or you want to continue testing traditional
Hugo themes, you can use Hugo-plus as any other Hugo theme. However, for Hugo-Plus
to work with a plain Hugo website, you must copy over Hugo-Plus' 'data/' directory
to your site. Also change the 'title' in 'config.toml' to 'home' so the configuration
of the homepage can be read from 'data/config/home.toml'.

First, [dowload hugo-plus directly](https://github.com/H4tch/hugo-plus/archive/master.zip),
or clone it by typing:
> git clone https://github.com/H4tch/hugo-plus/

If you don't have Hugo installed, [download it here.](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases)
and install it within your environment's `$PATH` or in your site's root directory.

Content is created using Hugo's `new` command from the top level directory.
> hugo new blog/first-post.md

This creates a new content post within the `blog` section of your site.
This content will be written and formatted using Markdown as denoted by the
`md` extension. Content is organized by Section and/or Taxonomy.

By default all content has `draft = true` set to prevent incomplete posts from
showing up in your feed. Set this to false when the post is finished.

To build the website run `hugo --buildDrafts` in the site folder.
To build and run a locally hosted server of your website, run `hugo server -w`.
You can connect to it in your browser by navigating to `localhost:PORTNUMBER`.
